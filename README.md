# project airbnb - team 5

Go to 'project 1- airbnb team- Final.ipynb' for final jupyter notebook and 'UofT Data Bootcamp Project 1-Final version.pptx' for the powerpoint presentation. 
 
Purpose: Conduct an analysis of various factors by Airbnb (in New York City) to identify trends that impact customer spending.

The following questions were analyzed:
   Do different neighbourhoods or neighbourhood groups differ in price?   
   Does the verification of the host impact the price of the listing?
   Does Construction year of the property impact the price of the listing?
   How prevalent are cancellation policies and do they impact the listing?
   Do number of reviews differ based on room type? Does the review rate number impact the price?

Generally, there were no clear correlations or trends identified in the analysis conducted so far. Additional data would be required to identify whether any further conclusions can be made.
